## Differences between React and Angular

_Overall, I like React much more than Angular. The components are much simpler to keep track of and the importing seems easier to me, although that is probably just because I have a basic understanding now. However, I did like how Angular had its own styles page for each component. It's hard for me to keep track of all the CSS in React and it takes me way to long to implement it which I found slightly annoying. So far I'm liking React much more than Angular though._
